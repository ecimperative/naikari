  <description>Aldarus has vast oceans filled with an organic sludge that has little to do with water. The atmosphere is toxic and will kill an unprotected human within minutes. The sludge in the seas is a good source of raw materials for all sorts of industries thô, and the lack of pollution controls on the planet make it very attractive for corporations.</description>
  <bar>The spaceport bar on Aldarus offers a variety of recreätional activities, such as gambling and competitive gaming. There are also walled-off booths for private conversations, in case the bar's main areä is a little too public for comfort. The music here can also be a bit grating on the ears.</bar>
