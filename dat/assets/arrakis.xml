  <description>Arrakis is a desert planet featuring dust storms which can rage for weeks. Water is hard to come by, so many locals make their living harvesting what little water is available and selling it on the market.</description>
  <bar>The Arrakeen canteen is one of the shadier bars in Empire space. You will scarcely find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.</bar>
