  <description>Belltower Station is a small Soromid military outpost whose main purpose is to keep the Adiadus system in line. Be√Øng this far from the Soromid core there is little interstellar traffic, some of the inhabitants occasionally start to wonder if they're really part of the Soromid collective at all. Belltower is here to remind them that they are.</description>
  <bar>The bar has a door that leads directly to the cell block. Prisoners here don't usually stay very long. Belltower has neither the capacity nor the authority to deal with more than petty criminals on its own. More serious offenders are transferred to the penal facilities on Agino, in the Zintar system.</bar>
