  <description>Not as nice as Varia in the Darkstone system, Buritt is, never the less, a reasonably habitable world. You will find much of the Dvaered middle class here, such as it is. You will also find a large-scale pollution of the natural environment but, with the Dvaered being Dvaered, no attempt is being made to address this.</description>
  <bar>If this spaceport bar didn't play a locally produced, incessant, droning, brain-melting music, it would be quite a comfortable place to be. But it does, so it isn't.</bar>
