  <description>Castellan III is, like most Dvaered planets, a mining world and, like most Dvaered mining worlds, the conditions are hellish. The planet has virtually no way to support natural life, so it needs a constant stream of resources to support it. The majority of these are food and medical supplies for the miners.</description>
  <bar>Castellan III's bar is surprisingly good. Perhaps it has to do with it being a favored haven for Dvaered officers. Perhaps it's that someone in a position of some power or influÃ«nce decided that a nice place for the miners to relax and recuperate was a good way to show off their philanthropy. Either way, it's appreciated.</bar>
