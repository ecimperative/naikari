  <description>Though the world of Corax might, in the distant future, become a semi-inhabitable world there will be precious few ores and minerals left (barring iron) by that point. The Soromid's ability to withstand unusual levels of environmental discomfort has given them a head start on this world in terms of resource extraction. Other life, it seems, will have to wait its turn.</description>
  <bar>Given the relative stability of this world the bar looks rather more Empire standard-issue than on many Soromid worlds. There are tables, chairs, dispensers, a barman and, most importantly, drinks. These there are in profusion, though with this being a smaller world, not in any great variÃ«ty. If you ask for a cocktail though, you'll likely be directed to one of the local sulphurous hot-water geysers.</bar>
