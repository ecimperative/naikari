  <description>Dono is one of the more laid-back Soromid worlds. It is quite Earth-like and the Soromid make use of the strange properties of the local flora and fauna in their genetic experiments. It is a quiet world, with little that stands out about it.</description>
  <bar>The bar's patrons are scientists, laborers and regular civilians, mingling with little conflict. The service is acceptable and the food and drink average. A sleepy little bar, that's for sure.</bar>
