  <description>Even the Dvaered realize that not every world can be devoted to industry. Food has to be grown somewhere. Hence, Dunmer is set aside for agriculture. Despite its small size, the planet actually has a significantly larger population than Castellan III, due to its much more pleasant climate.</description>
  <bar>This bar is populated by traders carrying food to Castellan III and beyond, farmers who maintain the agri-businesses and Dvaered soldiers who function as a garrison. The bar is lively and friendly, except for the dour soldiers.</bar>
