  <description>The Salvador system has little of worth or use to the Empire but it still has valuable minerals that it needs to mine. Hence a group of intrepid miners and traders have made this place their base of operations. Minerals are mined and refined here and traders take them in the deeper reaches of the Empire for profit.</description>
  <bar>This bar is home to several miners and their trade partners haggling and making deals over beer and coffee. The bar is large but it is still filled almost to the point of standing room only.</bar>
