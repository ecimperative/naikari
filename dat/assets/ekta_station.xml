  <description>With the influx of Proteron civilians into the planet Thavma, it soon became clear that a local shipyard would be useful. For that purpose, Ekta Station was built. While not as extensive as Apik Shipyard in terms of offerings, Ekta Station nonetheless manages to be a good source of ships and ship maintenance for locals.</description>
  <bar>Civilians, traders, and military personnel alike meet at this bar as they wait for the repairs and modifications of their ships to be finished. It's a small but cozy bar, with people constantly coming and going.</bar>
