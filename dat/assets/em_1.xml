  <description>Em 1 is a completely unremarkable world. It's just one of those places that contributes to the Empire's treasury and serves no other purpose of note.</description>
  <bar>The bar exclusively plays local music, serves local food and drink and provides mainly local news. The people here apparently seem to want to cling on to what little personality the world still has, for fear that Em 1 has really become just an extension of the Imperial economy.</bar>
