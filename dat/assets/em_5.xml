  <description>Deep within Empire space, Em 5 is a quiet world. Few would have ranked it highly in the spectrum of galactic politics, yet after the Incident it gained notability when it became a temporary refuge of the Emperor. In the time since it's become a popular place for the aristocracy to meet.</description>
  <bar>The Drunken Lobster has a plaque commemorating the time the Emperor spent on Em 5. It seems unlikely he ever visited this bar, though, given its less than refined patrons and threadbare furniture.</bar>
