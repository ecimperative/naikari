  <description>Emperor's Eye is the moon of Emperor's Fist and serves as the Emperor's personal planet ever since the destruction of Sol as a result of the Incident. Only those approved by the Emperor himself are allowed onto the planet, and tight security is maintained to protect the Emperor's safety and comfort.</description>
  <bar>The bar's patrons mainly consist of Empire personnel who provide security, and the occasional important politician. Ordinary civilians are generally not allowed, and there is a special alarm in place to order immediate clearing of the bar should the Emperor decide to pay a visit.</bar>
