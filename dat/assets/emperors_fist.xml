  <description>Emperor's Fist is intended to be a new homeworld for the Empire. Work was started shortly after the Incident vaporized old Earth, with plans to terraform this class C planet, chosen for its similar orbital and rotational periods to those of old Earth, into a new Earth-like world. The project is overseen by the Emperor himself, who lives aboard the Emperor's Wrath stationed nearby.</description>
  <bar>The bar is clearly designed to harken back to the lost Old Earth, containing various ancient artifacts and even old-school Earth clocks, albeit recalibrated slightly to better match the day length of Emperor's Fist.</bar>
