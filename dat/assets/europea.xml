  <description>Europea is almost completely covered in water, which was considered undesirable in the early days of the Second Growth. However, it was soon discovered that Europea's biosphere contained many organisms that were useful in the production of high-grade medicine and an exception was made. This means that Europea is one of the earliest O-class planets that were ever colonised. Today the world still thrives on its medical exports, th√¥ advances in pharmaceutical technology since the days of the Second Growth have rendered a considerable portion of it obsolete.</description>
  <bar>Perhaps uniquely in the galaxy, both the spaceport and its associated facilities are afloat without tethers. This means that the location of the spaceport itself changes over time as the platform is carried on the major currents that span the face of the planet.</bar>
