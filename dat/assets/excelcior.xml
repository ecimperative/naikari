  <description>The seat of the infamously rancorous Procyon Enclave of House Za'lek, this world also happens to be one of House Za'lek's richest and most productive worlds, which is what allows Procyon its hold on much of House Za'lek. Many scientific organizations and universities operate out of this planet and its Earth-like environment, helped along by Za'lek terraforming, makes it a popular site for retirees and vacationers.</description>
  <bar>This bar is full of shouting and arguments, with the occasional fist-fight, all based on matters that most laymen find difficult to understand, let alone pick a side on. There is a large quantity of food and drink spilled on the floors as a result of this and the harried staff seem relieved when you make sure to avoid provoking anyone or making eye contact.</bar>
