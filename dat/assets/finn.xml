  <description>Finn is a prison rock. Prisoners are put to work mining the barren planet for minerals, which is a significant source of profit for the Empire. Various human rights activists have accused the Empire of making prisoners work in dangerous conditions without pay and even falsely convicting innocent people to increase the workforce on Finn, but the Empire officially denies the allegations.</description>
