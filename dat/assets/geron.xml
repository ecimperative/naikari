  <description>Geron was once an Imperial colony, but when House Goddard was established and granted full authority over the system, it also acquired jurisdiction over Geron. In the decades that followed the Imperial bureaucracy was largely dismantled and replaced by a more gubernatorial arrangement. That improved the efficiency at which the world was run, but without its Imperial status the economy took a serious hit. Nowadays, Geron is a fairly average civilian world that houses the majority of Goddard's citizens.</description>
  <bar>Like many spaceport bars, this one is loud, crowded and a little smelly. In other words, it's a home away from home for those who make their living in space.</bar>
