  <description>Grindstone Shipyards is a private manufacturing plant owned by Titus Grindstone, a wealthy Fyrra Siriusite who has moved into the spaceship business. He is licensed to manufacture some of the more common civilian models, and his factory supplies a fair number of the surrounding retailers. Ships can also be purchased directly from this station.</description>
  <bar>Titus Grindstone likes to keep his potential customers in a good mood, which is why he has invested into a small yet luxurious spacedock bar on his manufacturing plant. It sports all the standard bar facilities, as well as ready access to the station's ship catalogue.</bar>
