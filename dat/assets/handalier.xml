  <description>Handalier is an unusual bastion of scientific research by Dvaered standards. Researchers here regularly correspond with the neighboring Za'lek on scientific research, which helps to maintain good relations between the two factions.</description>
  <bar>The bar is fairly typical for a Dvaered bar, except that it has various cutting-edge trinkets throughout which are scarcely seen in other parts of Dvaered space. Researchers regularly visit the bar to discuss their work with their colleagues.</bar>
