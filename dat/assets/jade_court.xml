  <description>Jade Court is a large judiciary installation. Though owned and operated directly by the Empire, the station is open to the public. Cases come here from all across the galaxy, presided over by judges who are officially not affiliated with any of the major factions, though it is an open secret that most judges are Empire loyalists.</description>
