  <description>Knive in the Knave system was a world the Empire once considered ripe for terriforming, but its incredibly hot and corrosive atmosphere proved to render this effort impossible. Rather than simply admit that a bad location was chosen, Imperial propaganda spun Knive as a perfect location for garbage dumping to save face, and the Empire installed a basic landing pad for garbage transport. While it is indeed regularly used for this purpose, only the most loyal Imperials buy this as an actual success story.</description>
