  <description>Koga has a highly active crust, and may describe the surface as being a reasonable facsimile of hell. They may not be too far off the mark, as lava flows and sullen rubble from the earth are quite common.</description>
  <bar>The bar has holos and pictures of the more spectacular activity of Koga's turbulent geography. The bar is known for the "Lava Storm" drink, which you need to sign a waiver to drink.</bar>
