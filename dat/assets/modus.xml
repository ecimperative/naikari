  <description>Modus is an unstable world, but it is surprisingly well populated. Something about the planet is greatly beneficial to human fertility, which makes it a popular destination for couples trying to conceive a child the natural way. Of course this is not without risk, as the planet's volatile nature claims a considerable number of lives every year.</description>
  <bar>This bar has chosen to constantly play a heavy beat music track. This is not because people like heavy beat music, but rather to mask the tremors the planet's unstable crust sometimes creates.</bar>
