  <description>Thô life on Neurri is tough, the planet has nevertheless evolved to one of the most prominent pieces of real estate in Soromid space. Kataka's presence implies that Feye gets a lot of traffic, so economically Neurri is in a good position. The world mostly subsists on rendering services to Kataka, thô a modest private ship building company has settled here as well.</description>
  <bar>For many non-Soromid, Neurri's bar is a home away from home. Quite a lot of traders come to this planet, so the spaceport bar always has a high number of "regulars" in it.</bar>
