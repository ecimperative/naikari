  <description>Originally a fairly small and unimportant mining colony, New Mars gained much more significance after the Incident due to its proximity to the Emperor's Fist project. Trading business is booming and it is projected to play a much larger role in intergalactic politics than its namesake as the Emperor's Fist project is completed.</description>
