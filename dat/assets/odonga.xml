  <description>This incredibly hot, inhospitible world is nonetheless a highly valued Dvaered mining colony. The intense heat makes it unsafe to go outside without a heat-resistent suit, and the spaceport essentially serves as little more than a trade hub, with traders choosing to make their stops as quick as possible. Even in this relatively climate-controlled are√§, the heat is unbearable.</description>
