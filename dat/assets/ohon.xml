  <description>Ohon is far from Mutris, but the hearts of its people are not. As devout as Siriusites come, they labor in Sirichana's name and never miss a prayer.</description>
  <bar>The bar is fairly tidy. It doubles as a small place of worship for Siriusite spacers who don't have time to travel to the urban centers and still want to practise their spirituality.</bar>
