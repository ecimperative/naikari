  <description>Olljan is an aquatic world with a rich variÃ«ty of indigenous plant and animal life. In particular, the ocean's chemical composition (which contains only 65% water, the rest is a mix of various chemicals) has given rise to unique and amazing single-cellular life are providing biologists and medical researchers with a wealth of information even today.</description>
  <bar>There is a running joke in Olljan's bar that one of the drinks available to customers is a glass of pure, unprocessed ocean water. This, of course, isn't true. The ocean's water would kill any human outright. Instead, the drink on offer is a blend of unknown recipe, which is completely safe to drink, but also utterly disgusting. It's amazing how many spacers really believe the story about the ocean water.</bar>
