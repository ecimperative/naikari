  <description>Praxis is an anomaly in Dvaered culture, known for its commerce rather than production of materials. Beginning as a small colony, it has become increasingly important since the Incident. Praxis is now considered one of the core Dvaered worlds, the gateway thr√ª which Dvaered ore and materials flow into Empire space.</description>
  <bar>While not nearly as pristine as many Empire bars, the Praxis bar is remarkably well-kept for a Dvaered bar.</bar>
