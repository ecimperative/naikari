  <description>Rhaana is one of the outer worlds of Dvaered control. The population is small and lives mostly in insulated containment centers. Nonetheless, it is a somewhat frequented stop for mercenaries and bounty hunters due to its proximity to pirate-infested space.</description>
  <bar>The bar is a standard-issue model, seen in most space stations. It is as oversized and dingy as any Dvaered bar.</bar>
