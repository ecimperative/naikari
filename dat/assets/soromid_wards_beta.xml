  <description>While Soromid Wards Alpha in Shikima handles seven out of ten gene therapy cliënts, it is ill equipped for some of the more invasive operations. Soromid Wards Beta, on the other hand, has several facilities that make such operations possible. Of course these advanced procedures come at a higher cost, so the cliënts visiting Beta tend to be from the upper classes of galactic sociëty.</description>
  <bar>The spacedock bar, which doubles as a waiting room for cliënts, provides its visitors with information on the services that are rendered on Beta, such as ocular augmentation, bone and muscle reënforcement, disease immunities and reproductive facility expansion.</bar>
