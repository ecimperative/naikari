  <description>Tau Station was constructed with the sole purpose of extracting valuable gaseous compounds from Tau Prime. Due to the gas giant's unusually strong storm activity, it was deemed to be more profitable to build an orbiting station than to build a floating mining platform.</description>
  <bar>An unneeded byproduct of processing some of Tau Prime's gaseous compounds is used in drinks here and is a local delicacy. It cre√§tes a particularly sensate fizz that those who drink it say is unlike any other drink in the galaxy.</bar>
