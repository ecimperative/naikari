  <description>Frozen worlds are usually not colonized unless there is very good reason. Vilati Vilata is no exception. The world offers a wealth of valuable natural resources, as well as expansive subglacial cavern systems that lend themselves quite well to human habitation. The Dvaered have based what would become one of their most successful industrial franchises on this planet, so althô nobody likes living here, the place is home to a sizeable amount of workers.</description>
  <bar>The bar is cold. It must be mentioned. Every effort has been made to minimize loss of heat from the building, but given the bar's close proximity to the spaceport, which is exposed to the elements, and the constant flow of customers, it has proven impossible to keep out the cold. This situation has given rise to a number of unkind jokes about the Vilati bar, which are told thrûout the galaxy.</bar>
