  <description>Vlexair is a harsh, frozen world. Formerly a lush paradise, a heavy abundance of flora caused greenhouse gas levels to plummet a few millennia ago, causing runaway global cooling which is expected to continue for at least a few million years. It is rather uncomfortable for humans, but still habitable, and its cold, dry climate makes it a perfect candidate for ship building.</description>
