  <description>Originally intended as a temporary colony to house those who work on terraforming Emperor's Fist, Vuere has become a permanent settlement as it turned out to be much easier to terraform. As such, public interest in the Emperor's Fist project has diminished despite the Emperor's continued insistence on completing the project.</description>
  <bar>The bar is decorated with posters calling for Vuere to become the new homeworld of the Empire, a sentiment which many patrons seem to agree with.</bar>
