  <description>Wellen is a good example of how poor Imperial planetary management can be. Started as a prestigious project, the world was to be a perfect society with good housing and facilities for everyone, lots of greenery, and no pollution. However, the Empire never supplied ample funds to cover these ambitions. Today Wellen is a slum of run-down, oftentimes half-finished buildings. Poverty is high and few pass up the opportunity to leave if they can afford it.</description>
  <bar>The spaceport was the first facility to be constructed on the planet when it was colonized, as is often the case. As such it is well-built and polished. The spaceport bar is quite respectable, as spaceport bars go. It's only when you leave the terminal and enter the urban areas that the poor living conditions begin to become apparent.</bar>
