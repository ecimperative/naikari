  <description>Zabween is an old station. It was first built as an outpost to fight piracy, but with the destruction of Haven it has settled into a more traditional role. It presently functions as a largely commercial station. It keeps a museum with all sorts of ships and weapons that were used in the final fight against Haven, and this museum serves as a source of advertisement for the station's now commercialized shipyard.</description>
  <bar>The bar walls are decorated with pictures of Empire soldiers who have fallen in the fight against Haven and piracy in general. It has become customary for the Empire to post pictures of the fallen, honoring those who gave their lives protecting the Empire's ideals.</bar>
