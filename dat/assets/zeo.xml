  <description>Most of Zeo's habitation is recently new. After the Incident, real estate prices had a major overhaul all across the galaxy, and the once neglected backwater world of Zeo quickly became prime land to settle for Imperial citizens. Th√¥ the population is still on the low side compared to older civilian worlds, the number of people living here rises by the day.</description>
  <bar>Because of Zeo's abrupt rise in value after the Incident, the antiquated facilities at the time had to be replaced to handle the influx of Imperial colonists. As a result, most of the infrastructure here is relatively modern. You won't find anything out of order or slow to respond in this bar.</bar>
