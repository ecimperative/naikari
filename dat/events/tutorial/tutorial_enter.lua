nofuel_text = _([[As you enter the system and look for a place to land, realizing you're out of fuel, Ian Structure shows up on your display. "Hi there! I see you've run out of fuel, and what a predicament, too; there aren't any planets that you can land on here. But don't worry, you can still refuel! It'll just be a little harder and more costly.

See you can hail any other pilot either by #bdouble-clicking#0 on them, or by targeting them with {target_next_key} and pressing {hail_key}. Once you've hailed them, you can request to be refueled. This isn't likely to work on military ships, but many civilians and traders will happily sell you some of their fuel for a nominal fee. When you find someone willing to refuel you, you will need to stop your ship, which you can do easily with {autobrake_key}, and wait for them to reach your ship and finish the fuel transfer.

"If there aren't any civilians or traders in the area, there's one other way: if you hail a pirate, you can usually bribe them to convince them to leave you alone. After you've bribed them, there's a good chance they'll be willing to sell you fuel as well if you hail them again! While having to trust a pilot isn't ideal, it's at least better than being stuck in open space with no rescue.

"Good luck!" Ian Structure terminates the communication. It looks like you'll have to talk to the other pilots in the system.…]])
nofuel_log = _([[You can hail any other pilot by either double-clicking on them, or by targeting them with the Target Nearest key (T by default) and then pressing the Hail Target key (Y by default). From there, you can ask to be refueled. Most military ships will not be willing to help you, but many civilians and traders will be willing to sell you some fuel for a nominal fee. When you find someone willing to refuel you, you need to stop your ship, which you can do with the Autobrake key (Ctrl+B by default), and wait for them to reach your ship and finish the fuel transfer.

If there are no civilians or traders in the system, you can alternatively attempt to get fuel from a pirate. To do so, you must first hail them and offer a bribe, and if you successfully bribe them, they will often be willing to refuel you if you hail them again and ask for it.]])

hostile_presence_text = _([[Ian Structure shows up again. "It seems you've entered a system with hostile pilots! This is the first of many, I'm afraid, so it's important that you know what to do to protect yourself.

"Obviously, one thing you can do is fight, assuming you have the capability. However, if you're outnumbered or unable to fight, there's still one more thing you can do: if you either #bdouble-click#0 on a hostile pilot, or target them with {target_hostile_key} and then press {hail_key}, you can open the communication window, where you can bribe the pilot so that they stop attacking you. This usually works with pirate scum, though it may be less effective against other factions.

"You can always check the faction presences of a given system by pressing {starmap_key} to open the star map. On the right, you will see a list of all factions present in the currently selected system, along with a number indicating how strong their presence is. This can help you stay out of hostile systems in the first place, if you wish.

"However you choose to do so, stay safe!"]])
hail_hostile_log = _([[You can hail a hostile pilot either by double-clicking on the pilot, or by targeting them with the Target Nearest Hostile key (R by default) and pressing the Hail key (Y by default).

nebu_volat_text = _([[You begin to notice your shielding equipment behaving somewhat erratically as you see Ian Structure show up on your view screen. "Exploring the nebula, eh? It seems you're in a portion of the nebula with some volatility. Specifically, the system you're in has a volatility rating of {volatility} GW. That means you are right now constantly taking that amount of damage. Your shields repel 85% of the damage due to the unique qualities of shielding, but your armor does not. You can see on your display that a warning is being shown indicating exactly how much shield and armor damage you are taking, based on the nebula's volatility rating. If you run out of shields, your armor will begin to rapidly lose its integrity. For this reason, you should try not to be put in a situation where your shields are inactive while traversing a volatile nebula.

"You can see the volatility of the nebula in any given system via the star map, which you can open by pressing {starmap_key}. Information about the selected system, which includes volatility, can be found in the bottom-left. Try not to go too far into the nebula, and if you see your shields starting to drop, I advise you retreat to where you came from immediately. Stay safe!"]])
