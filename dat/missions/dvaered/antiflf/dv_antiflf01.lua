We were in a firefight with a rogue terrorist, but the bastard knocked out our engines and most of our primary systems before we could nail him. Fortunately, I think we inflicted serious damage on him as well, so he should still be around here somewhere. My sensors are down, though, so I can't tell for certain."

The officer draws himself up and assumes the talking-to-subordinates tone that is so typical for Dvaered commanders. "Citizen! You are hereby charged to scout the area, dispose of the enemy ship, then deliver me and my crew to the nearest Dvaered controlled system!"]])

"Well done citizen," he says. "You have done your duty as an upstanding member of society by rendering assistance to an official Dvaered patrol. In addition, you complied with your instructions and destroyed a terrorist that threatened the peace and stability of the region. You have been rewarded appropriately." You check your balance and see that you have indeed been paid a reasonable amount.]])

However, you failed to comply with instructions, and let a potentially dangerous terrorist get away with his crimes. I will not apply any penalties in light of the situation, but consider yourself reprimanded."]])

"Incidentally, citizen. The Dvaered authorities are preparing a campaign against the FLF terrorists. You seem to be an able pilot, and we need a civilian ship as part of our strategy. If you are interested, seek out an official Dvaered liaison."

When he is gone, you find yourself wondering what this campaign he mentioned is all about. There is one way to find out if you are up to it.â€¦]])
