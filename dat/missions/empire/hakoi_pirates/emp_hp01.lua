I've heard good things about you and your commitment to the Empire, and if you are willing, I would like to recruit you on a more prestigious mission than those simple deliveries.

"I believe you are a native of {system}, yes? And we are aware that you ran into some trouble there while assisting an acquaintance of yours, Mr. Ian Structure. Of course, {system} used to be peaceful, but as you yourself experienced, pirates showed up in the system out of nowhere recently. We've been able to contain them for now, but we must find out where they came from.

"That's where you come in, {player}. As a native of {system}, I'm sure civilians will be more willing to talk to you than officers in uniform. Your assignment, then, will be to use your connections to question civilians. You will secretly wear a recording device so we can capture the full extent of your conversations and pick up on anything you may have missed. Well, {player}? Are you ready to perform this important duty in service of the Empire?"]])

Your reward will be {credits}." He hands you a tiny, plain-looking pin . "This is a listening device. You will wear it as you question the civilians. Do not draw attention to it and I assure you that no one will think anything of it.

"Well, then, {player}, I must be off now. I trust this mission is in good hands. Of course, keep a lookout for pirates while in Hakoi. We can't afford to draw attention to you, so you will not have an Imperial escort and will have to rely on your own guns and the protection of the local police. That said, good luck!"]])

It seems you have gathered enough information and can return to {planet}.]])

"I'm sure we will have a need to enlist your services again before long. I'll see you again at the bar here on {planet} when I have another mission for you. In the meantime, I would recommend purchasing a Mercenary License, if you haven't already, and giving some basic combat missions a try. I'm sure the experience will prove to be invaluable."]])
