  Drinking Aristocrat
  Author: geekt
  Idea from todo list.

  An aristocrat wants a specific drink which he recalls from a certain planet and will pay handsomely if you bring it. When you get to said planet it turns out the drink isn't served there but the bartender gives you a hint. You are then hinted until you end up getting the drink and bringing it back.

Thank you to Bobbens, Deiz, BTAxis, and others that have helped me with learning to use Lua and debugging my scripts in the IRC channel. Thanks as well to all those that have contributed to Naev and made it as great as it is today, and continue to make it better every day.

When you get close to his table, he begins talking to you as if you work for him. "This simply will not do. When I ordered this 'drink', if you can call it that, it seemed interesting. It certainly doesn't taste interesting. It's just bland. The only parts of it that are in any way interesting are not at all pleasing. It just tastes soâ€¦ common.

You know what I would really like? There was this drink at a bar on, what planet was that? Damien, do you remember? The green drink with the red fruit shavings." Damien looks down at him and seems to think for a second before shaking his head. "I believe it might have been %s in the %s system. The drink was something like an Atmospheric Re-Entry or Gaian Bombing or something. It's the bar's specialty. They'll know what you're talking about. You should go get me one.

text[3] = _([["What do you mean, you can't leave right away? Then why even bother? Remove yourself from my sight."

You give him his drink and tell him that it wasn't easy, and how many systems you had to go through. "Hmm. That is quite a few systems. No reason for you to be this late though." He takes a sip from his drink. "Ahh! That is good though. I suppose you'll be wanting to get paid for your troubles. You did go through a lot of trouble. Then again, you did take quite a long time. I suppose %s should be appropriate."

Considering the amount of effort that you went through, you feel almost cheated. You don't feel like arguing with the snobby aristocrat though, so you just leave him to his drink without another word. It's probably the most that anyone's ever paid for a drink like that anyway.]])
