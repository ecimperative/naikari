You express concern about the condition of the ship, but she assures you that she will fix it up as she gets enough money to do so. She gives you a friendly hug, thanks you, and hands you a credit chip. "Catch up with me again sometime, okay? I'll be hanging out in Soromid space doing my first missions as a pilot!" As you walk away, you see her getting her first close-up look at the mission computer with a look of excitement in her eyes.]])
