"See, I got aâ€¦ well, I can't say exactly, but a special contract that they say is going to get me in some hot water with some sort of militant anti-Soromid gang. Not just pirates, mind; they said I can expect to be bombarded by them like there's no tomorrow, which is why I can't go alone. {planet} in the {system} system is my destination, and as soon as you finish escorting me there, you'll be paid {credits}.

I must thank you for your assistance in this mission. It sounds like you've done a fantastic service. I apologize for not revealing the full scope of the mission to you, but it was a matter of national security. I trust you understand." She hands you a credit chip with the promised payment.
