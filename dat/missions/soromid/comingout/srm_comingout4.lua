"I'm using they/them pronouns again," they eventually say. "I've done more soul-searching and found that nonbinary transfeminine feels right to me." You thank them for telling you. "You're welcome!" they say. "And thank you for respecting that! I sure hope my parents do too. I was thinking of meeting up with them back at {destplanet}, but I must admit that I'm a bit nervous and not entirely sure if my ship is up for getting through that part of space yet.

"Oh! Actually, maybe you could help! I could meet up with you at {startplanet} and then you could escort me to {destplanet}. And I know I'd feel a lot better talking about this with my parents if you were there. What do you think, is that something you can do? I'll pay you, of course."]])

home_text = {}
home_text[1] = _([[You land and dock on %s, then meet up with both of Chelsea's parents. They welcome Chelsea and their mother gives them a warm hug, then releases them. Chelsea's father slightly waves, and the three of them start chatting.

Eventually, the topic of Chelsea's gender comes up. Chelsea explains that they are nonbinary and now use they/them pronouns similarly to when they explained it to you. Their mother thanks them for telling her and hugs them.

Chelsea's father sighs. "Well, if you really wanna go with that, I guess I'll humor you." You look over at Chelsea; it's obvious that they're hurt by this.]])
home_text[2] = _([[Chelsea's mother speaks up. "What do you mean, 'humor' them? You don't believe your own child about their personal experiences?"

"I mean, you wanna identify as 'nonbinary' or a Kestrel or whatever because it makes you feel better, we both know that's not true, but at least you're not one of those those sorofreaks."

You see a look of anger on Chelsea's face as they glare at their father. "What do you think you're doing, using that slur? We've been over this! The Soromid are people just like us! And I'm not pretending! Do you honestly think I'm fooling around and lying to you because it 'makes me feel better'? I'm telling you that I'm nonbinary because I really am nonbinary."]])
home_text[3] = _([[Chelsea's father sighs. "Look, you're my son, and you always will be, but those sorofreaks are messing with your head. You need to come back to the real world eventually. I know you will."

Chelsea snaps back. "I won't sit here and listen to you attacking the Soromid like that! I've made some great friends with Soromid folks! Business partners even! And it was a Soromid who gave me treatments to make me more comfortable in my body!

"I am not your son, dad, and I never will be. I'm your nonbinary child, whether you accept me or not. Not because of the Soromid 'messing with my head', but because that's what my gender is. You have no right to stop me from being me."]])
home_text[4] = _([[Chelsea's father pauses. "So you're even making business deals with sorofreaks, huh? And you're thoroughly convinced that you're this 'nonbinary' nonsense. It's like you've become a sorofreak yourself." He reaches for something you can't see. "You know what? You're right. You're not my son. I won't stand by and let the sorofreak agenda plague this galaxy!"

Suddenly, Chelsea's mother tackles her husband. That's when you see what he was reaching for: a laser gun. The two start to wrestle for control as Chelsea's mother shouts. "Run! Both of you! Get out of here!" Not needing to be told twice, you grab Chelsea's arm and run as fast as you can. Just as you make it out of view, you hear the laser gun fire.

With no time to lose, you and Chelsea dash into your ships and immediately start launch procedures just in time to see Chelsea's father appear and attempt to fire his weapon at Chelsea. The shots hit their ship, but deflect harmlessly off of their shields. Chelsea sends you a message saying that they're setting course for %s immediately.]])

end_text = _([[After docking on %s, you meet up again with Chelsea to see them sobbing and frustrated. "I should have known I couldn't trust him! He never was openly accepting when I came out as trans to him before and misgendered me multiple times, but I just hoped it was in my imagination, you know? And I had no idea he was so bigoted against the Soromid!" You tell Chelsea that it's not their fault. "I know, it's justâ€¦ I hope my mother is OK."

They wipe the tears from their eyes. "He had goons on our tail shortly after we left and that tells me that this isn't over. I'll need to make sure I'm prepared when I face trouble from him again. Heck, maybe I should get more of a battle-hardened ship.

"Thank you for your help, %s. This isn't the outcome that I wanted but I honestly could have died there if it wasn't for you. Here." They hand you a credit chip. "The payment I promised. I need to go build up my strength. Next time I see you, I swear, I'll have a ship that won't be left in a vulnerable position when I run into trouble!" You offer a hug and say your goodbyes, hoping that Chelsea will be OK.]])

You didn't see what happened, but as you and Chelsea ran away, you heard a gunshot.
