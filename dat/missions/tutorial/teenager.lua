-- MISSION: The macho teenager
-- DESCRIPTION: A man tells you that his son has taken one of his yachts without permission and
-- is joyriding it with his girlfriend to impress her. Disable the yacht and board it, then take
-- the couple back to the planet (destroying the yacht incurs a penalty)

He's taken my yacht to space without my permission, taking along his girlfriend. That boy is such a handful. I'm sure he's trying to show off his piloting skills to impress her. I need you to get out there, disable the yacht and take them both back here. Can you do this for me? I'll make it worth your while."]])

"Oh, and one more thing, though it should go without saying: whatever you do, don't destroy the yacht! I don't want to lose my son over this, so make sure you equip some non-lethal weapons, like ion cannons or Medusa missiles, or maybe a weapons ionizer. You should be able to find something suitable at the outfitter.

"Well then, I hope to see you again soon."]])

You march the young couple onto your ship and seal the airlock behind you.]])

"You've done me a service, captain," he says. "As promised, I have a reward for a job well done. You'll find it in your bank account. I'm going to give my son a reprimand he'll not soon forget, so hopefully he won't repeat this little stunt anytime soon. Well then, I must be going.
