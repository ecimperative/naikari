"You have made an excellent decision to purchase from Melendez Corporation! Our ships are prized for their reliability and affordability. I promise, you won't be disappointed!" You are skeptical of the sales pitch, of course; you really only bought this ship because it was the only one you could afford. Still, you tactfully thank the salesperson.

"Now that we have you out in space for the first time, how about I go over your new ship's controls with you real quick? No charge!"]])

nothanks_text  = _([["Ha, I guess you're eager to start, eh? Well, I won't hold you back. I have uploaded some useful information which you can review any time you like by checking the Tutorial section of your ship log. The ship log can be found in the ship computer, which you can access by pressing {infokey}, or by pressing {menukey} and clicking the 'Ship Computer' button. Good luck!" With Ian Structure now gone, you set off on your journey.]])

movement_text = _([["Alright, let's go over how to pilot your new state-of-the-art ship from Melendez Corporation, then!" You resist the urge to roll your eyes. "Moving is pretty simple: rotate your ship with {leftkey} and {rightkey}, and thrust to move your ship forward with {accelkey}! You can also use {reversekey} to rotate your ship to the direction opposite of your current movement, or to reverse thrust if you purchase and install a Reverse Thruster onto your Melendez Corporation starship. Give it a try by flying over to {planet}! You see it on your screen, right? It 's the planet right next to you."]])

objectives_text = _([["Perfect! That was easy enough, right? We at Melendez Corporation recommend this manner of flight, which we call 'keyboard flight'.

However, there is one other way you can fly if you so choose: press {mouseflykey} on your console and your Melendez Corporation ship will turn toward your #bmouse pointer#0 automatically! You can then thrust either with {accelkey}, the #bmiddle mouse button#0, or either of the #bextra mouse buttons#0. What method you use to pilot your ship is entirely up to you.

"Ah, you may also have noticed the mission on-screen display on your monitor! As you can see, you completed your first objective of the Tutorial mission, so the next objective is now being highlighted."]])

landing_text = _([["On that note, let's go over landing! All kinds of actions, like landing on planets, hailing ships, boarding disabled ships, and jumping to other systems can be accomplished by #bdouble-clicking#0 on an applicable target, or alternatively by pressing certain buttons on your control console. How about you try landing on {planet}? You can engage the automatic landing procedure either by #bdouble-clicking#0 on the planet or its radar icon, or by targeting the planet with {target_planet_key} and then pressing {landkey}. Give it a try!"]])

land_text = _([["Excellent! The landing was successful. Melendez Corporation uses advanced artificial intelligence technology so that you never have to worry about your ship crashing. It may seem like a small thing, but it wasn't long ago when pilots had to land manually and crashes were commonplace! We at Melendez Corporation pride ourselves in protecting the safety of our valued customers and ensuring that your ship is reliable and resilient.

"When you land, your ship is refueled automatically and you can do things such as talk to civilians at the bar, buy new ship components, configure your ship, and most importantly, accept missions from the Mission Computer. Why don't we look around? As you can see, we are currently on the Landing Main tab, where you can learn about the planet and buy a local map. Click all the other tabs below and I'll give you a tour through what else you can do on a planet. When you are done, click the 'Take Off' button so we can continue."]])

bar_text = _([["This is the Spaceport Bar, where you can read the latest news, but more importantly, you can meet civilians, hire pilots to join your fleet, and sometimes find unique mission opportunities! I recommend regularly talking to patrons at the bar, at least early on. Some may have useful tips for you, or you may even find a local to help you find nearby systems!"]])

mission_text = _([["This is the Mission Computer, where you can find basic missions in the official mission database. Missions are how you make your living as a pilot, so I recommend you check this screen often to see where the money-making opportunities are!

"When picking missions, pay attention to how much they pay. You'll want to strike a balance of choosing missions that you're capable of doing, but getting paid as much as possible to do them. Once you've accepted a mission, you can review it at any time via the ship computer by pressing {infokey}."]])

outfits_text = _([["This is the Outfitter, where you can buy new outfits to make your Melendez Corporation starship even better! You can fit your ship with new weapons, extra cargo space, more powerful core systems, and more! Regional maps which can help you explore the galaxy more easily can also be purchased here, as well as licenses required for higher-end weaponry and starships (such as our top-of-the-line Melendez Mule Bulk Cargo Starship, widely sought after for its unmatched cargo capacity).

"As you can see, a series of tabs at the top of your screen allow you to filter outfits by type: 'W' for weapons, 'U' for utilities, 'S' for structurals, 'Core' for cores, and 'Other' for anything else. Different planets have different outfits available; if you don't see a specific outfit you're looking for, you can search for it via the 'Find Outfits' button."]])

shipyard_text = _([["This is the Shipyard, where you can buy new starships to either replace the one you've got, or to add to your collection! You can then either buy a ship with the 'Buy' button, or trade your current ship in for the new ship with the 'Trade-In' button. Different planets have different ships available; if you don't see a specific ship you're looking for, you can search for it via the 'Find Ships' button.

"You have no need for this screen right now, but later on, when you've saved up enough, you'll likely want to upgrade your ship to an even better one, depending on what kinds of tasks you will be performing. I highly recommend either our Melendez Quicksilver Rush Cargo Starship for cargo missions that have a time limit, or our Melendez Koala Compact Bulk Cargo Starship for missions that require carrying large amounts of cargo. We sincerely thank you for shopping with Melendez Corporation!"]])

equipment_text = _([["This is the Equipment screen, available on all planets and stations with an outfitter or a shipyard. Here, you can equip your ships with outfits you own and sell outfits you have no more use for. If the planet or station you're landed at has a shipyard, you can also change which ship you're flying and sell unneeded ships and outfits. Selling a ship that still has outfits equipped will also lead to those outfits being sold along with the ship, so do keep that in mind.

"You will notice that your ship comes with two laser cannons by default. If you make any changes to your ship now, please ensure that you still have two weapons equipped, as you will need those later for practicing combat. Besides, flying around space without any weapons can be very risky."]])

commodity_text = _([["This is the Commodity screen, where you can buy and sell commodities. Commodity prices vary from planet to planet and even over time, so you can use this screen to attempt to make money by buying low and selling high. Here, it's useful to hold the Shift and/or Ctrl keys to adjust how many tonnes of the commodity you're buying or selling at once.

"If you're unsure what's profitable to buy or sell, the starmap (which we will cover later) allows you to compare known average prices across the galaxy. The news terminal at the bar also includes up-to-date price information for specific nearby planets."]])

overlay_text = _([["Welcome back to space, {player}! Let's continue discussing moving around in space. As mentioned before, you can move around space manually, no problem. However, you will often want to travel large distances, and navigating everywhere manually could be a bit tedious. That is why we at Melendez Corporation always include the latest Autonav technology with all of our ships! When your ship is piloted with autonav, while the trip takes just as long in real time, advanced Melendez Corporation technology allows you to step away from your controls, making it seem as though time is passing at a faster rate (a phenomenon we call 'time compression'). And don't worry; if any hostile pilots are detected, our Autonav system automatically alerts you so you can return to your controls, ending time compression. This can be configured in the Options menu.

"Allow me to demonstrate. To start with, please press {overlaykey} to open your ship's overlay map."]])

autonav_text = _([["Good job! As you can see, your overlay map shows several indicator icons. These icons represent objects in the current system that are visible to you: planets, jump points, ships, and asteroids. These icons are color-coded to indicate whether the objects are friendly, neutral, or hostile, and planets are also marked with symbols which serve the same purpose for colorblind accessibility.

"Now that the overlay map is open, you can use your mouse to interact with objects the same way you would with the actual object. In addition, you can fly to any location in the system automatically by #bright-clicking#0 on its corresponding location on the overlay map.

"Why don't you give it a try by using Autonav to fly over to {planet}? Simply #bright-click#0 on your overlay map's {planet} icon and watch in amazement as autonav takes you there quickly, easily, and painlessly."]])

target_text = _([["Great job! As you can see, by using Autonav, the perceived duration of your trip was cut substantially. You will grow to appreciate this feature in your Melendez Corporation ship in time, especially as you travel from system to system delivering goods and such.

"Let's now practice combat. You won't need this if you stick to the safe systems in the southern Empire core, but sadly, you are likely to encounter pirate scum if you venture further out, so you need to know how to defend yourself. Fortunately, your ship comes pre-equipped with state-of-the-art laser cannons for just that reason!

"I will launch a combat practice drone off of {planet} now for you to fight. Don't worry; our drone does not have any weapons and will not harm you. To start with, target the drone by pressing {target_hostile_key}."]])

combat_text = _([["Easy, isn't it? It's also possible to target any ship by clicking on it, but that method is often too slow for the heat of battle.

"As you can see, targeting the drone allows you to see information about the ship. More importantly, though, targeting the drone enables automatic weapon tracking systems which help ease aiming. When you are within firing range of a targeted ship, you will see a series of lines around your ship to help with aiming. The circle indicates where the targeted ship is expected to be by the time your bullets reach them, on average. If your weapons are within firing range of the target, you will also see a cross which indicates where your weapons are pointed at and a pair of lines on either side of the cross indicating how much your weapons will swivel to compensate for imprecise aiming.

"Your weapons are fired with {primarykey} and {secondarykey}. Give it a try and shoot the practice drone down!"]])

infoscreen_text =_([["Excellent work taking out that drone! By the way, you can configure the way your weapons shoot from the Weapons tab of the ship computer, which can be accessed by pressing {infokey} or by pressing {menukey} and then clicking on the Ship Computer button. The ship computer also lets you view information about your ship, cargo, current missions, and reputation with the various factions. You will likely be referencing it a lot.]])

cooldown_text = _([["Now, as you may have noticed while you shot down the practice drone, shield regenerates over time, but armor does not. This is not universal, of course; some ships, particularly larger ships, feature advanced armor repair technology. But even then, armor regeneration is usually much slower than shield regeneration.

"You may have also noticed your heat meters going up and your weapons becoming less accurate as your ship and weapons got hot. This is normal, but too much heat can make your weapons difficult to use, which is why we at Melendez Corporation recommend using active cooldown when it is safe to do so. Let's practice using it. Engage active cooldown and wait for it to cool your ship down completely. You can engage active cooldown by pressing {autobrake_key} twice."]])

jumping_text = _([["Good job! Your ship is now fully cooled off. In addition to using Active Cooldown, you can also cool off by landing on any planet or station.

"I think it's about time for a change in scenery, don't you? There are many systems in the universe; this one is but a tiny sliver of what can be found out there! Traveling through systems is accomplished through jump points. Like planets, you usually need to find these by exploring the area, talking to the locals, or buying maps. Once you have found a jump point, you can use it by #bdouble-clicking#0 on it.

Traveling long distances that way can be rather repetitive and inconvenient, however, so let's take a look at a better interface for traveling between stars: the starmap! To start with, please open the starmap by pressing {starmapkey}.]])

starmap_text = _([["Behold, perhaps the most useful tool in your arsenal! This map shows all systems that you know about, where you need to go for missions, and even detailed information about each system! The starmap also allows for much easier travel. By selecting a destination system that you know the route to and clicking the 'Autonav' button, autonav automatically plans a route for you and will pilot your ship all the way to the destination system, as long as your ship has enough fuel. Let me show you!

"I've taken the liberty of placing a destination marker on your starmap for the {system} system. All you need to do is click on that system, and then click on the 'Autonav' button. Once you've done that, you can sit back and relax as autonav takes care of the rest!"]])

fuel_text = _([["Was that easy, or was that easy? As you can see, the trip consumed fuel. You consume fuel any time you make a jump and can refuel by landing on a friendly planet. Standard engines have enough fuel to make up to three jumps before refueling, though higher-end engines have more fuel capacity and some ships may have their own supplementary fuel tanks. In any case, you will want to plan your routes so that you don't end up in a system where you can't land without fuel.

"Now, then, why don't we put your knowledge to the test? I have placed a new marker on your starmap showing the location of your final destination: {system}, the heart of the Empire and home to the Emperor's famous warship, the Emperor's Wrath. This time, you will need to use what I taught you to find your way to your destination on your own. Let's see what you've learned!"]])

ask_continue_text = _([[Ian Structure gives you a round of applause as you enter {system}. "Phenominal piloting, {player}! Truly stunning! I must say, you are a natural-born pilot and your new Melendez Corporation Starship suits you well! I have no doubt about it, you are ready to make your way in space, and I'm sure you will have millions of credits in no time!

"That said, there are other aspects of piloting I wasn't able to get into here. If you like, I can continue to give you guidance, free of charge! I promise to be unobtrusive; I'll just pop in and let you know about some other things when they become relevant. What do you say?"]])

continue_yes_text = _([["Splendid! I'll leave you to your travels and keep an eye out. If you miss or forget anything, check the Tutorial section of your ship log; it can be found in the ship computer, which you can access by pressing {infokey}, or by pressing {menukey} and then clicking the 'Ship Computer' button. Best of luck!"]])

continue_no_text = _([["Ah, ok! In that case, I wish you good luck in your travels. You can review all the information we've gone through by checking the Tutorial section of your ship log; it can be found in the ship computer, which you can access by pressing {infokey}, or by pressing {menukey} and clicking the 'Ship Computer' button. I may add additional entries to the Tutorial log if I think of them, as well. Thank you for shopping with Melendez Corporation!" Ian Structure ceases contact and you let out a sigh of relief. You had no idea the level of annoyance you were getting into. At least you learned how to pilot the ship, though!]])

movement_log = _([[Basic movement can be accomplished by the movement keys (Accelerate, Turn Left, Turn Right, and Reverse; W, A, D, and S by default). The Reverse key either turns your ship to the direction opposite of your current movement, or thrusts backwards if you have a Reverse Thruster equipped.

Alternatively, you can enable mouse flight by pressing the Mouse Flight key (Ctrl+X by default), which causes your ship to automatically point toward your mouse pointer. You can then thrust with the Accelerate key (W by default), middle mouse button, or either of the extra mouse buttons.]])
