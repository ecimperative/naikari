jump_text = _([["Thank you. As you can see, I've marked the {system} system on your starmap. That's the system we need to go to. Luckily, it seems you already know the jump point to get there, so if you just select {system} with the mouse and click the Autonav button, we should be there in no time!"]])

target_nearest_text = _([[As you enter {system}, you see an icon indicating another ship on your radar. However, something seems off. Sirens blare as you realize that the ship is hostile!

Seeing this, Albert's face goes pale. "N-no way! This is supposed to be the safe part of Empire space! Quick, {player}! Press {target_hostile_key} so you can aim your weapons at whatever that ship is!"]])

fight_text = _([[You engage the control indicated by Albert and see that it automatically sets your designated target to the nearest hostile ship, which is the one you noticed on your radar. With the ship targeted, you can see what it is now: a Pirate Hyena. The sight makes Albert hyperventilate despite your best efforts to calm him down.

Finally, Albert speaks again. "P-please, whatever you do, don't let that pirate kill us! Shoot them down or something!"]])

dest_text = _([[With the pirate now defeated, you see Albert visibly relax, though he continues to sweat nervously. "Th-thank you," he stutters.

"OK. I'm OK. Um, we need to get to {planet}. I don't know where it is exactly, but if you have enough talent to take out a p-pirate all by yourself, I'm sure you can manage. I know it's somewhere in this system, so you could either look around the system yourself or buy a map. You can use eitherâ€¦" Albert passes out from exhaustion before he can finish his sentence, and you decide to let him rest while you search for his destination.]])

pay_text = _([[As you finish the landing procedures and arrive on the surface of {planet}, you gently wake Albert. He flinches in surprise, but when he sees it's just you, he immediately relaxes. You tell him that you've arrived at his destination and in hearing this, he breathes a sigh of relief and follows you out of your ship. Once both of you enter the spaceport, he exhales and hands you a credit chip.

"Thank you," Albert says. "You've outperformed my expectations, saving me from certain death like that. I can't possibly thank you enough. As a token of my appreciation, I'm giving you double the fee I originally agreed to pay you." You take your payment and thank him for his kind words.

"Good luck on your travels, {player}, and I hope to meet you again some day!" Albert offers his hand, which you shake before he walks off.]])
