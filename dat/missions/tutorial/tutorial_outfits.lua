   MISSION: Outfitter tutorial
   DESCRIPTION:
      Player is asked to deliver cargo, but does not have enough cargo
      space to do so, leading to the mission-giver explaining how to add
      a cargo pod.

Terra, however, waves her hand to indicate that it isn't a problem. "Not to worry," she reassures. "You're not familiar with how to customize your ship, are you? I happen to know that the outfitter on this planet has Cargo Pods available, so you'll be able to take the mission no problem. Here, I'll show you! To start with, click on the 'Outfits' tab to go to the outfitter." She proceeds to the outfitter ahead of you.]])

I'm not a pilot myself, but I understand many pilots spend a lot of time customizing and improving their ships. Let's see, we're looking for the Cargo Pod outfit. You can find it more easily either by using the category tabs, or by using the filter box to search for it by name. In any case, once you locate it, select the Cargo Pod entry from the list and click on the Buy button, please."]])
