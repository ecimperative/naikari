  <description>The Buffalo XL is a staple among mid-sized freighters, particularly those carrying dense cargo, and one of the best-selling Nova Gear products. Its considerable power leaves it with few competitors in its size class, and more than a few combat vessels rely on it to move them and their arsenals into battle.</description>
