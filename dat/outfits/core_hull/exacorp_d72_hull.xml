  <description>The hull provides a ship's basic structure. It determines the ship's armor, which is the last line of defense against the hazards of space, as well as cargo space. Every ship must have a hull installed to be spaceworthy.

Exacorp Discovery hulls such as this one provide respectable armor and cargo space for a low price.</description>
