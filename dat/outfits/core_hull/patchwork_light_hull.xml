  <description>The hull provides a ship's basic structure. It determines the ship's armor, which is the last line of defense against the hazards of space, as well as cargo space. Every ship must have a hull installed to be spaceworthy.

While it keeps air from venting into space, hull maintenance like this should never be accepted by any pilot who can help it.</description>
