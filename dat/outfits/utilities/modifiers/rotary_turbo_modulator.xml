  <description>This device forces a surge of power through turreted weapons beyond what they're designed to handle, creating a boost in fire rate. The process is inefficient and produces a lot of heat, but many courier pilots consider this to be a worthwhile trade-off to stretch what little damage-dealing capability they have.</description>
