  <description>While many weapons on the market are available as turreted variants, some pilots wish to add this capability to weapons designed to be forward-mounted. For those pilots, the Turret Conversion Module is an excellent choice. While a bit heavy and energy-inefficient, this utility provides ful 360Â° rotation to all weapons onboard.</description>
