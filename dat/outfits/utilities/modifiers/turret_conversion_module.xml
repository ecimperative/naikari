  <description>While many weapons on the market are available as turreted variants, some pilots wish to add this capability to weapons designed to be forward-mounted. For those pilots, the Turret Conversion Module is an excellent choice. This utility provides full 360Â° rotation to all weapons onboard, greatly increasing fitting options.</description>
