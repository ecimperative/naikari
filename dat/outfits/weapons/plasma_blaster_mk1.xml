  <description>The Plasma Blaster fires superheated plasma which is very effective at damaging armor, but less effective against shields. Plasma weapon technology was developed by the Soromid to enable the cre√§tion of the organic weaponry Soromid ships are equipped with, but it was such a hit with bounty hunters that the Soromid continue to manufacture synthetic plasma weaponry such as this as well.</description>
