#.
#. Choose an outfit from a table of outfits.
#.
#. `set` is split up into sub-tables that are iterated thru. These
#. tables include a "num" field which indicates how many of the chosen
#. outfit to equip before moving on to the next set; if nil, the chosen
#. outfit will be equipped as many times as possible. For example, if you
#. list 3 tables with "num" set to 2, 1, and nil respectively, two of an
#. outfit from the first table will be equipped, followed by one of an
#. outfit from the second table, and then finally all remaining slots will
#. be filled with an outfit from the third table.
#.
#. If, rather than equipping multiples of the same outfit you would like to
#. select a random outfit `num` times, you can do so by setting "varied" to
#. true.
#.
#. "probability" can be set to a table specifying the relative chance of
#. each outfit (keyed by name) to the other outfits. If unspecified, each
#. outfit will have a relative chance of 1. So for example, if the outfits
#. are "Foo", "Bar", and "Baz", with no "probability" table, each outfit
#. will have a 1/3 chance of being selected; however, with this
#. "probability" table:
#.
#. @code
#. probability = {["Foo"] = 6, ["Bar"] = 2}
#. @endcode
#.
#. This will lead to "Foo" having a 6/9 (2/3) chance, "Bar" will have a 2/9
#. chance, and "Baz" will have a 1/9 chance
#.
#. Note that there should only be one type of outfit (weapons, utilities,
#. or structurals) in `set`; including multiple types will prevent proper
#. detection of how many are needed.

#. Rescue script for stranded pilots.
#.
#. The basic structure is as follows:
#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or structure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-thru to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.

#. Determines whether the player is stranded.
#.
#. In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy
#. and the planet has no outfitter or shipyard.
#.
#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.
#.
#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,
#. consisting of the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.

#. to determine where the problem lies, so let the player sort it out.
