#. --
#. -- ``set`` is split up into sub-tables that are iterated through. These
#. -- tables include a "num" field which indicates how many of the chosen outfit
#. -- to equip before moving on to the next set; if nil, the chosen outfit will be

#. -- table will be equipped, followed by one of an outfit from the second table,
#. -- and then finally all remaining slots will be filled with an outfit from the

#. -- If, rather than equipping multiples of the same outfit you would like to
#. -- select a random outfit `num` times, you can do so by setting "varied" to

#. --
#. -- "probability" can be set to a table specifying the relative chance of each
#. -- outfit (keyed by name) to the other outfits. If unspecified, each outfit
#. -- will have a relative chance of 1. So for example, if the outfits are "Foo",

#. -- chance of being selected; however, with this "probability" table:
#. --

#. -- This will lead to "Foo" having a 6/9 (2/3) chance, "Bar" will have a 2/9
#. -- chance, and "Baz" will have a 1/9 chance
#. --
#. -- Note that there should only be one type of outfit (weapons, utilities, or

"\"Listen, I need to explain some background. As you know, Nexus designs are "

"and mercenaries as well. Aerosys dug into a lot of the Fighter market with "
"their Hyena design, but we were successful in convincing them to join a "
"partnership with us, bundling the ships with Nexus engines and paying us a "
"royalty for each sale. On the other hand, our former dominance in the "
"Cruiser market was shattered by the sudden appearance of Krain Industries, "
"who produced a lighter and cheaper Cruiser, and rather than accepting our "
"deal to bundle our engines, they developed their own Remige Engines. We "
"still sell Hawkings, of course, but pirates have taken a liking to Krain's "
"design and we just no longer make as much money in that market as we used "
"to.\n"

"Sirius space, planning to launch test markets in Frontier space. When we "
"reached out to them, they refused a partnership with us. They're turning "
"into another Krain Industries, and we cannot have that. Nexus dominance in "
"the Fighter market must be sustained.\n"

"some hopefully revealing conversations between a sales manager of the new "
"startup and representatives of the Frontier. All we need you to do is meet "

#. * They are run in a shared state. All global variables will be the same for all outfits of the same type.
#. * You can use the 'mem' table to access memory for the particular outfit being used.

#. Rescue script for stranded pilots.
#.
#. The basic structure is as follows:
#.
#. If the player lacks any core outfits, either:
#.
#. a) The ship's defaults are added to the empty slots
#. b) All cores are replaced with the ship's defaults
#.
#. If that fails, then the player is presented with various options:
#.
#. a) Remove all non-cores
#. b) Remove weapons, utility, or structure outfits separately
#. b) Replace cores with defaults
#.
#. There is no failure mode beyond this, as a ship that isn't spaceworthy
#. in its default state already generates warnings on load.
#.
#. This script has two known flaws at the moment. Players aren't considered
#. stranded if the outfitter sells outfits that can fill all missing slots,
#. or replace existing cores. This is done without regard to affordability.
#.
#. The second is that some conditions (e.g. free cargo space) are independent
#. of outfits, and because we don't explicitly check them, fall-through to the
#. final "this is a bug, please report" happens more than it ought to.

#. In the simplest case, a player is stranded if their ship isn't spaceworthy

#. If the player isn't missing any core outfits, and has non-core outfits
#. equipped, we let them resolve the issue manually.
#.
#. The last simple case is: If the planet has a shipyard that sells ships the
#. player can afford, the player is not considered stranded.
#.
#. From there, it gets decidedly more complex. An outfit pool is created,
#. consisting of the player's inventory, plus:
#.
#. a) If the planet has a shipyard, the player's other ships' outfits
#. b) If the planet has an outfitter, the outfitter's stock
#.
#. At this point, the player is only stranded under two circumstances:
#.
#. 1) They're missing core outfits and nothing in the pool fits.
#. 2) The ship is bare aside from core outfits, yet isn't spaceworthy
#. and no other suitable core outfits are available.
#.

#. Player has no ability to fix whatever's wrong, definitely stuck.

#. If the player can afford another ship, they're not stranded.

#. to determine where the problem lies, so let the player sort it out.
#. Add the player's other ships' outfits.
#. Add outfits sold by the outfitter.
